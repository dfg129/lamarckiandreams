export const manifesto = 'Love the quick profit , the annual raise, <br/> vacation with pay. Want more <br/> of everything ready-made. Be afraid <br/> to know your neighbors and to die. <br/> And you will have a window in your head. <br/> Not even your future will be a mystery <br/> any more. Your mind will be punched in a card <br/> and shut away in a little drawer. <br/> When they want you to buy something <br/> they will call you. When they want you <br/> to die for profit they will let you know. <br/> So, friends, every day do something<br/>that won\'t compute. Love the Lord.<br/>Love the world. Work for nothing.<br/>Take all that you have and be poor.<br/>Love someone who does not deserve it.<br/>Denounce the government and embrace<br/> the flag. Hope to live in that free<br/> republic for which it stands.<br/>Give your approval to all you cannot<br/>understand. Praise ignorance, for what man<br/>has not encountered he has not destroyed.<br/>Ask the questions that have no answers.<br/>Invest in the millennium. Plant sequoias.</br>Say that your main crop is the forest<br/>that you did not plant,<br/>that you will not live to harvest.<br/>Say that the leaves are harvested<br/>when they have rotted into the mold.<br/>Call that profit. Prophesy such returns.<br/>Put your faith in the two inches of humus<br/>that will build under the trees<br/>every thousand years.<br/>Listen to carrion - put your ear<br/>close, and hear the faint chattering<br/>of the songs that are to come.<br/>Expect the end of the world. Laugh.<br/>Laughter is immeasurable. Be joyful<br/>though you have considered all the facts.<br/>So long as women do not go cheap<br/>for power, please women more than men.<br/>Ask yourself: Will this satisfy<br/>a women satisfied to bear a child?<br/>Go with your love to the fields.<br/>Lie easy in the shade. Rest your head<br/>in her lap. Swear allegiance<br/>to what is nighest your thoughts.<br/>As soon as the generals and the politicos<br/>can predict the motions of your mind,<br/>lose it. Leave it as a sign<br/>to mark the false trail, the way<br/>you didn\'t go. Be like the fox<br/>who makes more tracks than necessary,<br/>some in the wrong direction.<br/>Practice resurrection'
